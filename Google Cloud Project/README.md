# ☁️ Google Cloud Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for data engineering workflows.  
It focuses on building a pipeline for data ingestion, transformation, and analysis in the cloud.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- **Services Used:** (update with specifics, e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, AI Platform)  
- **Goal:** To process and analyze data at scale using cloud-native tools.  

---

## 🛠 Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion** – Loading raw data into Google Cloud Storage / BigQuery  
2. **Data Transformation** – Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering  
3. **Analysis / ML** – Running queries, analytics, or ML training (depending on scope)  
4. **Visualization** – Creating charts or dashboards (if included)  

---

## 📊 Example Results
- Successfully loaded data into BigQuery tables  
- Performed transformations with SQL / Python APIs  
- (Add a quick result summary here, e.g., insights, aggregated metrics, or ML outputs)  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `google-cloud` Python SDK  
- pandas / NumPy (data wrangling)  
- (Add others if you used them, e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn)  

---

## 📌 Files
- `Google Cloud Project.ipynb` → main notebook with pipeline + analysis  
- (Add additional files here, e.g., SQL queries, configs, datasets)  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Automate pipeline with **Cloud Composer (Airflow)**  
- Add monitoring / logging for production use  
- Scale dataset size and performance test queries
